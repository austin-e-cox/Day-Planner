# Day-Planner
quick and dirty day planner that utilizes local storage for persistent data in the text fields

## Functionality
The page is minimalistic, with a number of hour rows that are color coded by past (red), present (green), or future hour (blue).
Each row has a text field that the user may enter data into, and a save button.
When the user presses the save button, the field is saved into local storage.
Each text field has its text reloaded when the page is reloaded.
